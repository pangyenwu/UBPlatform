# UBPlatform
Project Idea:

Creating a online platform for the University at Buffalo students to exchange or sell a school supplies directly. 
For an example. The price at book store is extremely expensive for UB students. Many UB student have books left from preivous year. So this platform would enable student to exchange or buy book individually in an afforable price.
